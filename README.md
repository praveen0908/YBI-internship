# YBI Foundations Machine Learning Internship

Welcome to the YBI Foundations Machine Learning Internship! This repository contains information and resources related to my internship experience.

## Overview

- **Intern:** Praveen Kumar S
- **Organization:** YBI Foundations
- **Duration:** May to July of 2023

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for handwritten digit recognition. The goal is to build an accurate and efficient system that can recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9) into their respective categories. Handwritten digit recognition has widespread applications, including digitizing handwritten documents, postal automation, and digit recognition in forms.

## Repository Structure

- **/code**: This directory contains the codebase for the project.
- **/data**: Data files and datasets used in the project.
- **/docs**: Any documentation or reports related to the internship.
- **/models**: Saved machine learning models or checkpoints.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and experimentation.

## Getting Started

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of handwritten digits, preferably the MNIST dataset, which is a popular choice for this task.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by normalizing, resizing, and augmenting the images to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning model for the task. Common choices include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and decision trees.

Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed dataset. Experiment with hyperparameters and model architectures to optimize performance.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: If applicable, deploy the model as a web application or API for real-time handwritten digit recognition.

Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation explaining the project's architecture, data preprocessing steps, model selection rationale, and deployment instructions.

Testing: Thoroughly test the model with various handwritten digits to ensure robustness and accuracy.
